After some online research I found that github has documentation on git runners. On githubs docs there are multiple pages dedicated to git runners. There is a page on the differences between standard runners and self-hosted runners. There is also a page on how to make a self-hosted runner. On youtube I found a lot of additional tutorials on how to make git runners.
