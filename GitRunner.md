# Why
While I was setting up the workflow for my projects, I noticed that I was automaticly using the github runner. I was curious about what a runner exacly was and if it was possible to make one myself.

# Options
I found that is was possible to make a self-hosted runner and that there were a lot of ways to do it. You can host one physical, virtual, in a container, on-premises, or in a cloud. You can add your self-hosted runner on three levels. It can be in a single repository, in one organization or in multiple organizations using an enterprise account.

# Advantages
One of the most important advantages of using a self-hosted runner is that they are more customizable. An other advantages is that unlike the standard github runner, an self-hosted runner doesn't need to have a clean instance for every job execution. There is also a financial advantage. The github runner is only free for a set amount of minutes per month.
