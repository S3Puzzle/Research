# why
While I was setting up the workflow for my projects, I noticed that I was automaticly using the github runner. I was curious about what a runner exacly was and if it was possible to make one myself.
!!
I found that is was possible to make a self-hosted runner and that there were a lot of ways to do it. You can host one physical, virtual, in a container, on-premises, or in a cloud.
