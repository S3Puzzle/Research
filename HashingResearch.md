## What different kinds of hashing algorithms are there?

Two of the most popular hashing algorithms are MD5 and SHA. MD stands for Message Digest and MD5 is the fifth version. SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithms and is a group of diffrent hashing algorithms. They are first two algorithms were SHA-0 and SHA-1. After these two cam SHA-2 and SHA-3, these can be seperated in more versions. These versions differ in outcome size and other important parameters.

## How do hashing algorithms work?

Hashing algorithms are often used to secure passwords. When a user enters a password the hashing algoritm turns the password into a hash before storing it. When the user tries to login and enters the password, the entry is put in the hashing algoritm. If the hash is the same, the password is the same. This way you can use a password, without actualy having to store the exact password. How the hashing algorithm
